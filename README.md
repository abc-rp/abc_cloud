# Installation
 ABC Cloud Installer

The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of Ansible playbooks that can be used to install a range of ABC Cloud components via Ansible on Kubernetes (k8s).

These include:
  - TICK Stack
  - MQTT Broker
    
We will initally target Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and k3s.
